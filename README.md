# "_ChatGPT as a Conversational Recommender System: A User-Centric Analysis_"

We report the data and compiled results for the under-reviewed research work. 

1. The file named '_ChatGPT API parameters selection_' includes details on adjusting the ChatGPT API parameters for generating responses. 

2. The file named '_Compiled study results_' serves as a bird-eye view of the compiled results of our online study. We provide the preprocessed data of user ratings in the directory named '_Study data parsed_'.   

3. The file named '_Correlation with linguistic metrics_' includes the complete data and computational results for the additional analysis reported in the manuscript.

4. The file named '_Failed cases_' includes the complete data regarding failed cases (i.e., user rating = 1 or 2). In addition, we provide the statistics and data for challenging dialog intents for unique cases, also reported in the manuscript.
